# CS311 Knapsack — Greedy and Randomized Analysis
### This project is part of CS311 course [Design & Analysis of Algorithms] taught by Dr. Mohamed Tounsi


#### Comparative implementation and analysis of **greedy** and **randomized** strategies for solving the **Fractional** and **0–1 Knapsack** problems using **Java Dynamic Programming** as the optimal baseline.

## Overview
This project explores multiple heuristic (greedy/randomized) approaches and compares their performance and optimality against the DP-based exact solution.

> **Note:** Some functions and methods are **not yet implemented**.  
> Full functionality (as described above) will be added in the next few days. Thx :)
